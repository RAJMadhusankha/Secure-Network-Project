# 🌐 Secure Network Design – Cisco Packet Tracer Project

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a **secure, segmented network** using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. It covers essential enterprise-grade security features including routing authentication, time synchronization, centralized management, VLAN segmentation, and strict access control.

## 🔐 Key Features

- ✅ **Secure OSPFv2** using MD5 authentication  
- 🕒 **NTP Server** configuration for accurate time synchronization  
- 🔧 **Remote Management** using a TACACS+ server  
- 🖧 **VLAN segmentation** with **Port Security** enforcement on access switches  
- 🚫 **Access Control Lists (ACLs)** to filter and restrict traffic between networks

## 🖥️ Network Overview

- 6 networks (A–F) across multiple VLANs and routers  
- Web server restricted to certain networks  
- ICMP/HTTP/HTTPS traffic filtered via ACLs  
- Port security with violation actions (restrict/shutdown)

## ✅ How to Use

1. Open `Secure Network Design in Cisco Packet Tracer.pkt` in Cisco Packet Tracer  
2. Follow along with `Secure_Network_Report` to understand the setup  
3. Test connectivity using ping, browser, and terminal tools  
4. Observe ACL restrictions and port security actions
